Step 3: LangGraph ReAct Agent

This script demonstrates:
1. How to build a ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) agent using LangGraph
2. How to define and use tools for external data access
3. How to implement state-based decision-making with Pydantic
4. The difference between linear chains (LCEL) and cyclic graphs (LangGraph)

ReAct Pattern:
- The agent Reasons about what it needs to do
- Then Acts by choosing appropriate tools
- Observes the results
- Repeats until it can provide a final answer

Key Concepts:
- State Management: Using Pydantic classes to define agent state
- Tools: Functions the agent can call to access external data
- Graph Structure: Nodes (agent, tools) connected by conditional edges
- Decision Logic: Agent decides when to use tools vs. respond directly

    """
    Pydantic model defining the state of our ReAct agent.

    Using Pydantic provides:
    - Type safety and validation
    - Clear documentation of state structure
    - Automatic serialization/deserialization
    - IDE autocomplete support

    The 'messages' field tracks the entire conversation history,
    including user queries, agent responses, tool calls, and tool outputs.
    """
    # arbitrary_types_allowed = True
    # ==============================
    # This Pydantic configuration setting allows the model to accept fields with types
    # that Pydantic normally doesn't support or validate (like custom classes, complex objects, etc.).
    #
    # WHY WE NEED THIS:
    # - LangChain's message objects (HumanMessage, AIMessage, ToolMessage, etc.) are complex
    #   custom classes that don't follow Pydantic's standard validation patterns
    # - Without this setting, Pydantic would raise validation errors when trying to store
    #   these message objects in our state
    # - This is required for LangGraph state management when using LangChain messages
    #
    # IMPORTANT: This disables some of Pydantic's type checking for these fields,
    # so use it only when necessary (like with LangChain framework objects)
    model_config = ConfigDict(arbitrary_types_allowed=True)

    # add_messages Operator
    # ======================
    # The Annotated[list, add_messages] syntax combines type hints with LangGraph-specific behavior:
    #
    # 1. WHAT IS IT?
    #    - 'add_messages' is a special LangGraph reducer/operator function
    #    - It defines HOW state updates are merged when new messages arrive
    #    - Without it, new messages would REPLACE the entire list instead of appending
    #
    # 2. HOW IT WORKS:
    #    - When a node returns {"messages": [new_msg]}, LangGraph needs to know:
    #      Should it replace the old messages or append to them?
    #    - add_messages tells LangGraph: "Append these new messages to the existing list"
    #    - It intelligently handles message deduplication and updates
    #
    # 3. WHY WE NEED IT:
    #    - Preserves conversation history across multiple agent/tool invocations
    #    - Each node can add messages without worrying about losing previous context
    #    - Essential for the ReAct loop where agent → tools → agent needs full history
    #
    # 4. SMART BEHAVIOR:
    #    - If a message with the same ID exists, it gets updated (not duplicated)
    #    - New messages are appended to the end
    #    - Maintains chronological order of the conversation
    #
    # EXAMPLE:
    #   Initial state: messages = [HumanMessage("Hi")]
    #   Node returns: {"messages": [AIMessage("Hello!")]}
    #   Result: messages = [HumanMessage("Hi"), AIMessage("Hello!")]  ← APPENDED, not replaced!
    #
    # WITHOUT add_messages, the result would be:
    #   Result: messages = [AIMessage("Hello!")]  ← REPLACED the entire list!
