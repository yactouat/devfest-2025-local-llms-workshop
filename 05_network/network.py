"""
Step 5: The Network/Swarm Pattern

This script demonstrates:
1. How to build a decentralized multi-agent system
2. How agents communicate directly with each other through handoffs
3. How to implement peer-to-peer agent collaboration
4. The difference between hierarchical (Supervisor) and network patterns

Network/Swarm Pattern:
- Agents operate as peers without a central controller
- Agents can directly handoff tasks to each other
- Each agent decides independently when to involve others
- Flexible, dynamic collaboration based on task needs

Key Concepts:
- Decentralized Control: No single supervisor coordinating work
- Peer-to-Peer Handoffs: Agents directly transfer control to each other
- Autonomous Decision Making: Each agent chooses when to handoff
- Bidirectional Communication: Agents can call each other as needed
